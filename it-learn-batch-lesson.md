# "How Can I See Which Batches Have a Lesson?"

1. learn.co/curriculum
2. Search for Lessons by Keywords (name of lesson)
3. Expand the "Used in ## lessons" triangle:
	 ![Summary of Lesson in Tracks](img/it-learn-batch-lesson-1.png)
4. See breadcrumb paths associated by the names.
5. Click link on the name of the lesson in a given track
6. Viol&aacute; &mdash; you'll now see the Track on the side.
7. Sadly, the UI doesn't expand out to show you where the Lesson fits. You'll
   have to use the breadcrumbs from the previous page to expand the tree.

8. You can use the expanded tree to get a feel for how the lesson fits into the
   overall flow.
9. There's a GitHub octocat icon which will take you to the
   `learn-co-curriculum` canonical repo.
