# Weekly Cadence

## Introduction

This document describes a weekly flow for how things generally work in the
team. We have project obligations and operational obligations and, as such, we
want to make sure that we stay aware of our workload _and_ emit signals of
progress / stability as we go about our work.

----

## Monday

Thank goodness it's Monday! We're glad you're here.

### Standup

1. Review our [monthly commitments](./this_month.md). Determine if any of these
   are in jeopardy.

### Operations

1. Check in on the [Github issues report][gir]. If you don't have the ability
   to view this, check out the [Instructor App][ia] page. The goal here is to
   check what happened since last Thursday and see if something has gone horribly
   wrong.
2. Spend an interval (~1 hour) burning down our "current focus." As of writing
   (2018-02-15), FI has a substantial backlock of operational issues. Here's some
   regularly slated time to make sure we're clearing this out.

### Project

Work on projects.

_Guideline_: You should have ~60% free for this.
