Steven Notes (from meeting with Online Ed; RR = Rebekah Rombom)
* Identify two separate online programs:
  * "structured programs"
  * "self-paced online"
* Maintaining what "structured programs" get is curated / interfaced by a guru
  for each structured program. For FSWD, it's Cernan.
  * Risk: Is the know-how here locked in a person (Wünder-Cernan) or has it
    been documented as part of the role?
  * Do we document that this ability is a responsibility of his role as we
    launch new products?
* Self-paced Online
  * RR: Are driven by percentage complete, highly sensitive b/c it gateways
    their graduation. Change averse b/c this lengthens their run-time
  * RR: Continue 3-level split: those who must upgrade, those who can choose,
    those who are exempt
  * Requires the "Curriculum Swap" work
  * Instead of forced movement to new track, we should encourage them to
    upgrade as a "carrot" – in order to receive our next update ("Something
    Exciting"), you need to adopt this change – with its impact to your
    progress-to-goal
  * Eventually, this population will age out (might be veeeerrrry eventually)
* Structured Programs
  * Because structured programs have a guru, the guru acts to curate deployment
    in a style very similar to what happens in in-person groups!
    * Opportunity: Paves the way to have structured-programs AND in-person use
      the same resources. Paves the way to converging curriculum
    * The guru can "add" and then mark self-paced online as "retired" (still can't truly
      delete) but can use words and TCFs to get the flexibility that Learn
      blocks
