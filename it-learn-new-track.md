# How Do I Create / Populate a New Track?

1. Visit learn.co/curriculum
2. (+) Create track
3. Enter Title. Pro-tip from Jason Decker: copy and paste from the old version
   so that you don't make an error. Typically the entry would be of the form
   $PRODUCT-v1 to $PRODUCT-v2
4. Select the newly created track
5. Under the track name, hit the "circle." As you hover it will become a plus.
   Click the plus. ![Select the Plus](./img/topic_find_plus.png)
6. You can now choose to create a topic or find a topic. In the event that
   you're basically copying from one pre-existing topic to populate this
   current track, you might navigate to the pre-existing track and slurp-in
   the pre-existing topic. You could then delete away the imported lessons
   that you don't need. <br/> ![Add a Topic](./img/topic_add_create_find.png) <br/>
   **Alternatively** you could choose to *create* a Topic. After you create a topic
   you can click the "circle" under the topic and Find or Create Lesson to populate
   the topic. There are two approaches here:
   1. Create a repo in the `learn-co-curriculum` org using the "New Repository"
      process in GitHub. You can then "Find Lesson" in Learn and include it in
      the Topic
   2. Choose "Create Lesson" which will launch an editor and create a repo for you.
      This interface is more buggy and is not actively encouraged by the Product
      team. For this reason **we recommend you follow the process described above**.
