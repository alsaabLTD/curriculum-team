# The Job

## Introduction

What is it to be a curriculum writer? It's a lot of things based on a lot of
different expectations. In many ways it's a brand new type of career that
blends technical writing, creativity, teaching, and programming acumen in a new
and exciting way. The world is still discovering this answer, and so are we.

While the exact nature of the role has yet to be fully defined, we believe that
you, our new team-mate, have demonstrated enough flexibility and capability in
a wide variety of faculties such that we think you are a curriculum writer.

## Primary Goal

To create and craft learning experiences that allow Flatiron School learners to
gain the learning objectives that will enable successful job placement
outcomes.

## The Learners

The learners are enrolled in two programs:

* The two primary adjectives are: **Intensive** _or_ **on-site** used to describe
  the experience started in New York City under the "bootcamp" model. This has 
  grown to encompass other sites (DC, London, etc)
* **Online**, self-paced program ("the online program")

## Character Expectations

* You understand, support, and embody the [Flatiron Values][about-FI-school]
* You care about writing and you care about your audience. We do a lot of
  writing
* You care about process and believe it can make your life easier

## Typical Daily Tasks

* Review a piece of curricular writing. Is the human-oriented text inspired and
  engaging? Is the computer-oriented text technically correct, clear, and
  appropriately formatted?
* Write a shell script to emit template files
* Catch up on changes in ActiveRecord 5.0 that will need to be propagated into
  a series of repositories.
* Contribute to our book club!
* Help "program" a new offering as Flatiron expands into a new market

## Required Skills

* **Communication**: Ultimately many of our choices hinge on something subjective:
  "This _feels_" or "I don't think the audience would know this." Being able to
  _communicate_ in a non-confrontational way is the sign of a skillfull
  collaborator.
* `git`: We treat our words _like code_. We analyze, we parse, we pick at, we
  delete that which doesn't work, _like code_. A tool that allows us to move
  fast and change things is `git`. While you needn't be a guru, familiarity with
  `git diff` and `git add --patch` behooves you.
* **Programming** and an eye to automation: The number of challenges we have _is not
  small_. We achieve good scale on Flatiron's investment by building tools, reducing
  hand-cranked work, and seeking automation.

## Getting Started

Flatiron Curriculum operates very similarly to a software development
operation. We are project-based, so we can't provide a list of tasks that you
will immediately work on. Here are some skills and documents that will put you
in position to be able to contribute.

* [Review a typical review][review]
* Look at currently open issues
  * [All](http://instruction.learn.co/curriculum/github_issues_report/open)
  * [Last 7 days](http://instruction.learn.co/curriculum/github_issues_report/last_week_issues)
  * [Pretty Graphs!](http://instruction.learn.co/curriculum/github_issues_report)

## Tools

* **Email** is a Google Apps based email `@flatironschool.com`. This is the primary
  tool for _official_ communication. Use this for *important* but not
  necessarily *urgent* communications. It's more formal than Slack. Be advised
  mails are often forwarded on to other teams / collaborators. Importantly,
  this tool is also used for meeting / collaboration scheduling
* **Google Calendar**: We rely on our calendars. Use your calendar to guard your
  time. You are expected to accept meeting invites and propose collaboration
  via this tool. You should not check for availability and then also schedule
  an invite. Conversely, if you need to NOT be available, there's nothing wrong
  with blocking out time. You can publish the reason or not. You're a
  professional, you know when you need focus time.
* **Slack**: A chat-room / virtual shared workspace app. You should be subscribed
  to certain channels by default. Ask for an invitation to `#curriculum` for
  curricular discussion. Those reporting into curriculum are also invited to the
  `#curriculum-internal` channel. The latter is "safe zone" for team discussion
  (and private).
