# How Can I See What This Look Like In Learn?

It's natural to wonder what code youre looking like in Markdown will look like
once it's distributed "out there."

## Process

1. Identify the name of the lesson "selecting-single-elements-readme"
2. Visit http://learn.co/curriculum
3. Enter the name of the lesson in the search box
4. Use the disclosure triangle to show the appearances of the lesson
5. In this example, `selecting-single-elements-readme` appears in 6 lessons.
   You can use the "breadcrumbs" to understand how it appears in Learn. The top
   level "track" can be selected by looking at the first breadcrumb. In the
   example we'll correlate "abcp" to "accelerated prep" where we expect to find
   the `selecting-single-elements-readme` content.
6. Change to the track and select the appropriate, topic, unit descent to see
   the lesson.
