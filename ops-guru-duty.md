# Ops Guru Duty

## Introduction

In order to keep our assets in a good state, we are going to pursue a weekly
rotation of having someone manage our "managed sections." 

"Managed sections" are sections that, after January 2018, we have cleaned up
and are actively monitoring. We don't want to see a mount up of issues in these
sections. When we do, it's signal that something's "wrong in the bones" of the
lessons.

## Process

In the instructor app we have a summary of the status:

`http://instruction.learn.co/curriculum/github_issues_report/open/managed_sections`

The Guru then has the option to solve these issues themself or to assign these
issues to available curriculum members. Curriculum members are expected to have
any assigned issues addressed by THURSDAY of the given week.

The goal of the guru is to tell Steven on Thursday "All the managed sections
have 0 issues."
