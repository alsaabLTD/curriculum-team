# Review Example

In order to give a taste of what our reviews should look like and what the
appropriate level of thoroughness is, we have created an [example][] branch of
a detailed review dating from 2017-12-27.

## Things of Note

As of the [pre-review commit][prc], we have a friendly, approachable piece of
content. Jason's done a fine job. But as a reviewer, like a good TDD testing
partner, we have to be critical and exacting in every word, every sentence,
every paragraph.

Every word has to work.

* Up early / up late and tired
* Nervous about their future
* Excited by the material
* Infinitely motivated *but* also very unexperienced

Our goal is to make their _ingestion of the content easy_ because the knowledge
is, as programmers know, _not easy_.

As writers, editors and reviewers we grow by practicing. We should expect to
receive critical, but kind and professional feedback.
