# Finding Issues

If you're looking for some work to do, here's how!

1. Navigate to http://learn.co/curriculum
2. Choose the track you're interested in (likely "Full Stack Web Development
   V#")
3. Change top-level headings to "Track Health"
4. Expand a Unit ("ORMs and ActiveRecord") with the disclosure triangle
4. Expand a Sub-Unit ("ActiveRecord") with the disclosure triangle
5. Click on a Topic ("Intro to Rake")
6. You will see PRs and Issues. These are where you can start work, validate
   PRs, and groom the entity.

Considerations:

If you make a change to the README on `master`, you probably need to make that
change in `solution` as well.

If you add a test in `master`, you need to add that test, and its resolution, in
`solution`.

These are some mechanics that you'll need to reason about, but are a bit of an
art, you'll probably need help reasoning about these. Don't be afraid to ask a
friend here!
