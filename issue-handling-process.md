## Four Types of Issues

 * The issue is simply a misunderstanding the student has. Please tell them to
   ask a question using Slack or the ask a question feature and close the issue
```
 Hello,

It looks like this isn't a bug in the curriculum, but a misunderstanding you
have with the material. That's no problem though! Go ahead and hit the Ask A
Question button on learn.co. Either a community member or a technical coach
will be able to help you understand this stuff.

Good luck.
```
 * The issue is a bug in the IDE. Tell them, this looks like a bug with your
   IDE setup please email support@flatironschool.com or refer to our help
   center here: http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide
```
Hello,

Looks like this may actually be a problem with your Learn IDE. To get this
resolved, send an email to support@flatironschool.com or take a look at our
help center here: http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide.

Good luck
```
 * This actually is an issue with the lab! Make a PR, tag the PR against the
   Issue and then close the issue and PR
 * This is an issue that you can't replicate. Ask the reporter for more
   details...then check back in a week. If they haven't responded close the
   issue (with a smile! and a comment) and ask them to re-open if they come across
   the issue again.

**Once you complete the PR you have two options:**

 * It’s something simple. Things like "spec\_helper wasn’t included". Just test
   it, and then merge it in. Generally these are things that are just "doesn’t
   work"
 * It is a large "doesn’t work" this means writing a lot of text in the README,
   writing a ton of tests, changing significant portions of the solution. Tag
   me (@sgharms) as the assignee and I’ll take a look!
