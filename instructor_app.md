# The Instructor App

## Introduction

A guide to installing the Instructor App, a Rails application that hosts many
data analytics functions.

## Repository

https://github.com/flatiron-labs/instructor-app-v2

## Installation

Curriculum has updated the README based on our experience installing the
application.

## Curriculum Concerns

It's a Rails app, but we're being "mounted" as a separate application. As such
you'll find that `app/{controllers,views,models}/curriculum_application/` holds
our domain logic.
