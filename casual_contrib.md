# How Can I Help

Hi!

First of all, thanks for taking a look here. In Curriculum we have a ton of
work and a ton of stakeholders (students, teachers, coaches, employers). We're
busy!

Thanks for even considering giving a moment of your precious time.

## Baseline

Many requests take the form of "Can I make a change?" or "Can I update
something?" The answer is YES. How well and quickly we can integrate these
challenges is a major question for the road ahead.

## I Want To Update a Lesson Or Lab

1. Read the [style guide](./style_guide.md)
1. Create an issue that reports the problem
1. Create a pull request with your solution
1. Notify #curriculum on Slack

## I Want To Change The Way We Teach a Topic (order)

Phew, this one is a bit dicier. What if your change sets us backward (I'm sure
it won't) or what if another teacher disagrees with you? And how will whatever
process we describe here work with more schools and more curricula?

It's a hard problem and we're finding our way. We just don't have a process
yet. Talk to #curriculum and we'll try to help get the change integrated.
