for anyone filling in for you.

## Monday

### Monday Kick-Off Meeting

1. (_With team_) Review our [monthly commitments](./this_month.md). Determine
   if any of these are in jeopardy.
2. (_Solo_) Review our [Online Team Impact page][impact-page] from Section Leads
  * Look for new top contenders. Week to week you should see the bad kids
    staying bad kids. If something new comes running up the ranks that's a bad
    signal.
  * This is low-urgency, but high-importance
3. (_Solo_) Review [Question Volume by Lesson][qvl] from Section Leads
  * Look for new top contenders. Week to week you should see the bad kids
    staying bad kids. If something new comes running up the ranks that's a bad
    signal.
  * This is low-urgency, but high-importance
4. (_Solo_) Review [Github Known Issues Health Sheet][gki]
  * You're looking for the count of rows to have increased dramatically
  * Typically if the team's actively reducing the issues in an area and the KI
    count increases dramatically it means we're turning "point issues" into
    "zone issues." This probably signals that a rewrite of the section is due
    or that the team is mis-assessing the appropriateness of attacking the
    point issues
  * This is low-urgency, but high-importance
5. (_With Team_) Review [Github issues chart][gir].
6. (_With Team_) Schedule an interval (~90 minutes) burning down our "current focus."
7. (_With Team_) Assign the [ops-duty guru](./ops-guru-duty.md)
8. Get a Stand-Up report for the week?
  * What'd you do last week
  * What will you do this week
  * Any blockers / help / contingencies
