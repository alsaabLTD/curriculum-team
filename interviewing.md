# Interviewing

## Introduction

Curriculum authors in the technical education space are rare birds indeed. Some
are more writers who know a bit about technology; some are teachers who love to
write; some are teachers who want to have a bigger impact. There's no set path
for a successful candidate.

## Typical Backgrounds

A junior-level writer would be someone who has:

1. Demonstrable coding experience (~< 2 years)
2. Demonstrable writing samples / skills
3. Some teaching / empathetic education capacity

Senior-level writers will be distinguished by:

* Duration, breadth of exposure to larger technical organizations
* Breadth of familiar technologies (e.g. "C, Java, Ruby, and Python")
* Level of education
* Experience

## Desired Artifacts

* GitHub repository
* Published technical writing / technical education writing
* Response to a [Writing Sample](#writing-sample)

## Writing Sample

To create an even bar across candidates we have created the repository:

https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/git-interview-baseline

Here we ask candidates to edit a legacy snapshot of a document about git
revision control. How they respond and what they catch will be informative
about their pedagogical priorities.
