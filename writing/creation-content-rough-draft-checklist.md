# Writing Stages: Rough Draft Checklist

- Details for each Learning Goal are fleshed out.
- Code examples and/or imagery are thoughtful and explained well with
  accompanying images if necessary.
- Lesson is easy to comprehend--it's written on a 6th to 8th grade level.
- Narratives and metaphors are relatable to the broadest audience possible.
- Any key words or terms are _emphasized_ and defined.
- All shortcuts, acronyms or commands are defined or explained.
- The material shows why or describes a scenario where we've asserted that the
  knowledge is important or true.
- Limited use of overly vague or colloquial language like “stuff” and “things”,
  or “radical” or “gnarly”.
- The [Curriculum style
  guide](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/curriculum-team/blob/master/style_guide.md)
  has be adhered to. Tick off code words, capitalize where necessary, make sure
  formatting is correct, etc.
- Make it clear when a method ought be known (memorized) versus (referenced).
`map` should be _known_, `each` should be known. If the burden of mastery is
higher (map, each, reduce), then make sure the content is explained. If we have
laid out paradigmatic examples, it's OK to reference. That is, if `each` has
been taught, `each_by` can be referred to as something to pick up via a link in
the **References** section.
