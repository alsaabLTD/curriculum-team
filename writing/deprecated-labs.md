# Deprecated Labs

## What is a Deprecated Lab?

* It has been rewritten in another repo
* If it's been incomplete for 2+ semesters / tagged as a WIP for that long

If you come across a lab that we should not deploy, be sure to do the following:

* Raise an issue, and tag as **deprecated**
* If this lab is being replaced with an upgraded version, link to that lab
