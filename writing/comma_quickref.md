# When to use a comma

1. Use a comma before any coordinating conjunction (and, but, for, or, nor, so,
   yet) that links two independent clauses.
2. Use a comma after a dependent clause that starts a sentence.
3. Use commas to offset appositives from the rest of the sentence.
4. Use commas to separate items in a series.
5. Use a comma after introductory adverbs.
6. Use a comma when attributing quotes.
7. Use a comma to separate each element in an address. Also use a comma after a
   city-state combination within a sentence.
8. Also use a comma to separate the elements in a full date (weekday, month and
   day, and year). Also separate a combination of those elements from the rest
   of the sentence with commas.
9. Use a comma when the first word of the sentence is freestanding "yes" or
   "no."
10. Use a comma when directly addressing someone or something in a sentence.
11. Use a comma between two adjectives that modify the same noun.
12. Use a comma to offset negation in a sentence.
13. Use commas before every sequence of three numbers when writing a number
    larger than 999. (Two exceptions are writing years and house numbers.)
