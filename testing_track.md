# Testing Track

First: **tracks cannot be destroyed**

Therefore: **we have a test track**

and... **you should not count on this to be anything but ephemeral; data might
be lost, etc.**. That said: you could Slack the channel before you do any
overhauls that break things.

Also: **you should break the binding between the track to your test batch when
you are done so someone else can use this track**

**Track Name**: [curriculum-livetrack-test][test]

[test]: https://learn.co/curriculum/tracks/32272

## Tracks

Tracks need to have **2 levels of depth** before you start adding lessons.

## Find Your Batch

Try using [sgharms test webdev fund](https://learn.co/batches/539).

If you need to create a batch beyond this, let's talk about it in-channel.

## Add the Test Track as the Track to your Test Batch

If you need to create your own batch, add `curriculum-livetrack-test` as a
track that's assigned to it.
