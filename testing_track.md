# Testing Track

First: **tracks cannot be destroyed**

Therefore: **we have a test track**

and... **you should not count on this to be anything but ephemeral; data might
be lost, etc.**. That said: you could Slack the channel before you do any
overhauls that break things.

Also: **you should break the binding between the track to your test batch when
you are done so someone else can use this track**

**Track Name**: [curriculum-livetrack-test][test]

[test]: https://learn.co/curriculum/tracks/32272

## Tracks

Tracks need to have **2 levels of depth** before you start adding lessons.

## Find Your Batch

Try using [sgharms test webdev fund](https://learn.co/batches/539).

If you need to create a batch beyond this, let's talk about it in-channel.

For documentation's purposes, if you needed to create a batch, here's how
you'd do it:

1. Visit: https://learn.co/batches
2. For testing purposes you want to create the batch below a nesting level
   that makes sense. `Curriculum (Internal)` is where `sgharms-test-webdev-fund`
   lives. You might need to create a track underneath another heading.
3. Select, from the left bar, the container that's most appropriate. The Learn
   Admin UX is a bit..unreliable, so this step might not be necessary but, as
   you'll see in subsequent steps, you can't specify the container elsewhere,
   so this might be a required step. Sorry for the cargo-culting.
4. Click "+ Batches" at the top
5. Here you can create your new batch. You *might* think that you could specify
   the container (per 3, above) but it doesn't seem like it. So, that's why 
   step 3 exists. Specify your admins and specify the default track that the
   batch is to be populated with.
6. Viol&agrave;! You have a batch!
## Add the Test Track as the Track to your Test Batch

If you need to create your own batch, add `curriculum-livetrack-test` as a
track that's assigned to it.
