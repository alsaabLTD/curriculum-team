# Reviewing Content

## Spike

### Questions to Ask

- Does the narrative example:
  - Present a problem?
  - Create a sense of urgency to solve that problem?
  - Provide enough clear details for the scenario to be relable and understandable?

## Outline

- Define Learning Goals
  - Are existing Learning Goals broken down to focused topics?
  - If necessary, do research on the topic at hand to see what others feel are important to know about it
  - Organize the learning goals in such a way they will flow well together
  - When discussing intro or “beginner” topics, be sure to break down concepts into more granular learning goals. Don’t assume the student has any technical background, and would understand. 
- Write a strong Intro. The intro can create a narrative that would be relatable to an average person. Be careful not to make too many really specific pop culture references that some students, especially international, may not understand. 
  - This is where you might establish a handful of keywords, _emphasized_, that you will be defining and discussing throughout the lesson.
  - Define, define, define!
  - Are all shortcuts, acronyms or commands defined or explained?
    - For example: the `-v` flag in `git remote -v` stands for "verbose"
- Write a rough Conclusion by summarizing what was discussed in the Learning Goals. 
  - We can preview what may be to come in the next lesson (depending on if these are outside of the brick format that could change the order or presence of lessons).
  - We can write a couple of sentences that reassure the student that they will be be able to understand the content with practice, or explain why everything they just read will be important in their learning journey and dev career.

## Rough Draft

- Flesh out the details for each Learning Goal. 
  - No high-level abstraction
  - If the added bulk of the Learning Goals is making the lesson very long (1000 words or more), consider breaking out additional Learning Goals and topics into a new lesson.
  - If a Learning Goal has many sub topics that are more than a couple of paragraphs, consider making them their own Learning Goals.
- Whitespace is easier on the eyes for reading. Paragraphs can be short and less dense than we may be used to seeing in literature.
- Be thoughtful about code examples and/or imagery. 
  - Are there existing graphics where needed to illustrate points?
  - Are all concepts accompanied with examples?
  - Are all examples provided with enough detail?
  - Preference is given to images/gifs that illustrate a concept over media that are “reactions” (like a celebratory thumbs up), and other extraneous media content that isn’t furthering a student’s understanding of a concept.
  - An educational gif may be something like a Terminal window that we see in TV and movies, or what a real terminal window looks like on a computer.
- Write on a 6th to 8th grade level.
  - Is the reading level appropriate? Do not to use overly complex words. 
  - If technical terms need to be used, make sure they are being defined either in the narrative, or in parenthesis. ex: “the command line interface (also known as CLI)
- When writing narratives or metaphors, keep them as relatable as possible to the broadest audience. eg: References to common experiences like a list students in various classrooms, vs. Harry Potter and Harry Potter specific references that might involve different Harry Potter houses that not everyone will have context on.
  - Again - define, define, define! Are all new vocabulary or important terms bolded or italicized in the text where appropriate to indicate their introduction/importance?
  - For example, when discussing file structure and navigation, is the concept of a "directory tree" explained before referring to movement "up and down?"
- Material does not simply assert something is true without showing why or describing a scenario where that knowledge is important
- If possible, over-using vague and colloquial language like “stuff” and “things”, or “radical” or “gnarly” that is not to be translated literally.
- Iron out any remaining grammatical errors and typos. If sentences are getting too long, break them up into shorter, succinct sentences that are easier to understand.
