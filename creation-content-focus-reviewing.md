# Reviewing Content



## Questions to Ask

- Does the narrative example:
  - Present a problem?
  - Create a sense of urgency to solve that problem?
  - Provide enough clear details for the scenario to be relable and understandable?
- Are the Learning Goals broken down to focused topics?
- Are there graphics where needed to illustrate points?
- Are all concepts referred to in passing adequately explained?
  - For example, when discussing file structure and navigation, is the concept of a "directory tree" explained before referring to movement "up and down?"
- Are all concepts accompanied with examples?
  - Material does not simply assert something is true without showing why or describing a scenario where that knowledge is important
- Are all examples provided with enough detail?
  - No high-level abstraction
- Is the reading level appropriate?
- Are all new vocabulary or important terms bolded or italicized in the text where appropriate to indicate their introduction/importance?
- Are all shortcuts, acronyms or commands defined or explained?
  - For example: the -v flag in "git remote -v" stands for "verbose"
