# Your First Day

Welcome to your first day in Flatiron School Curriculum!

* Be sure and read [The Job](./the_job.md)
* Make sure you have the right tools (see: README)
* Make sure you know how to process issues (see: README)
* Take a look at [New Project Deploy](./major_project_deploy_new_version.md).
  This describers one of our most complicated and difficult projects. By
  looking at our approach here you'll get a good read on the culture of the team
  and see several key parts of IT infrastructure.
* Make a meantiful addition to this wiki before you close out for the first
  day. Try to reach beyond grammar and spelling &mdash; resolve a mystery that
  the docs didn't help with, link together ideas that needed linking, make the
  path all the better for whoever comes after.
* Make sure you have a standing 30-minute meeting with your manager. This is
  your 1:1. That will be your time to talk about anything you want and to make
  sure that your manager knows about you, how you can be helped, areas where you
  are excited to grow, etc.
