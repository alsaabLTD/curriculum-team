# Your First Day

Welcome to your first day in Flatiron School Curriculum!

* Be sure and read [The Job](./the_job.md)
* Make sure you have the right tools (see: README)
* Make sure you know how to process issues (see: README)
* Make a meantiful addition to this wiki before you close out for the first
  day. Try to reach beyond grammar and spelling &mdash; resolve a mystery that
  the docs didn't help with, link together ideas that needed linking, make the
  path all the better for whoever comes after.
