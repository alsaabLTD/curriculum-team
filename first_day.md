# Your First Day

Welcome to your first day in Flatiron School Curriculum!

* Be sure and read [The Job](./the_job.md)
* Make sure you have the right tools (see: README)
* Make sure you know how to process issues (see: README)
* Take a look at [New Project Deploy](./major_project_deploy_new_version.md).
  This describes one of our most complicated and difficult projects. By
  looking at our approach here you'll get a good read on the culture of the team
  and see several key parts of IT infrastructure.
* Read up about the organziations / batch / track architecture. You might never
  actually work on engineering this app, but you'll definitely work with it in
  a power-user sense! [Read](./tracks-batches-orgs-learn.md)
* Request admin permissions to active tracks in Learn.co from 
  [@sgharms](https://github.com/sgharms) or [@peterbell](https://github.com/peterbell). 
  This will give you access to courses that students are seeing, and give more 
  insight as to what the students are experiencing! It may not be necessary knowledge 
  to complete day-to-day tasks, but can help inspire improvements to our curriculum
  as the platform evolves over time.
* [ "How Can I See Which Batches Have a Lesson?"](./it-learn-batch-lesson.md)
  shows how to ask Learn about a given lesson / track relationship. This will
  help you get oriented quickly.
* Make a meaningful addition to this wiki before you close out for the first
  day. Try to reach beyond grammar and spelling &mdash; resolve a mystery that
  the docs didn't help with, link together ideas that needed linking, make the
  path all the better for whoever comes after.
* Make sure you have a standing 30-minute meeting with your manager. This is
  your 1:1. That will be your time to talk about anything you want and to make
  sure that your manager knows about you, how you can be helped, areas where you
  are excited to grow, etc.
* Read the [Flatiron School Style Guide][brand-book]
* Add yourself to the [Team List](./team_members.md)

## Important Knowledge

* Instructional assets live in learn-co-curriculum/repo
* Students experience things in learn-co-students/repo
* Don't make changes in learn-co-students
* If you add a branch in learn-co-curriculum **it will be instantaneously
  downstream replicated** &rarr; unless &larr; it starts with `wip-`
