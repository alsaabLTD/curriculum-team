# Can Curriculum Be A Career Step For Me?

Good question. Maybe :)

A proposed career path is the following

1. TCF
2. Rotation in Curriculum and / or
3. Rotation in Engineering
4. Reentry as Senior TCF (_but **not** as a lead_)

The general guideline is that an individual would begin as a TCF and grow in
mastery in that role. Time in-role required to move out would be dependent on
previous experience, aptitude, etc. so there are not hard rules here.

The essential difference between a TCF and Senior TCF is the concept of
_experience_. You will need to get experience. One option would be to leave the
company: do engineering, do writing, work at startups, wear many hats.
**HOWEVER** we would like to _keep_ your talent here. If you work with the
facutly manager to track your growth to being elgibile to "rotate out."

Without the faculty manager's consent, outward rotation **is not possible**.
The factulty manager, curriculum manager, and engineering manager will work to
afford you the opportunities to reengage as a senior TCF.
