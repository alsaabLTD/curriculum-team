# Join The Curriculum Team!

## Introduction

Curriculum authors in the technical education space are special and rare
creatures.

Some authors have a writer pedigree and have learned a bit about technology;
some are teachers who love to write; others are teachers who want to have a
bigger impact; yet others are technologists who feel an urge to give back by
capturing their experience.  In short, there's no set formula for describing a
successful candidate profile.

Nevertheless, if you believe curriculum authoring is a super-power for you, we
would love to get to know you better.

## Personality Traits

What we seek is for someone who has:

* **Empathy** for the learner: You know what the learner has seen, you know
  what questions they likely have and you have a plan for solving them lesson
  by lesson until the learner attains their learning objective(s).
* **Narrative-orientation**: You can imagine the story the learner
  needs to inhabit in order to "discover" the lesson
* **Technical familiarity**: You can "play test" a lab as a technologist, you
  can look up the latest documentation, you can recognize when a section needs
  to be rewritten to meet a new standard
* **Good writing hygiene**: Good spelling, good grammar, obviously. But
  curriculum writers hunt down imprecise pronouns, they discuss word choice and
  word order. They make sure that the vocabulary isn't too specialized or
  daunting to English non-native learners. You must love words and writing in
  this role.

## Typical Backgrounds

A junior-level writer has:

1. Demonstrable coding experience (~< 2 years)
2. Demonstrable writing samples / skills
3. Some teaching / empathetic education capacity

In the demonstration of these qualities by means of cover letter, GitHub
profile, writing sample, etc. the candidate will show how the desired traits
manifest in their experience and artifacts.

Senior-level writers will be further distinguished by:

* Duration, breadth of exposure to larger technical organizations
* Breadth of familiar technologies (e.g. "Ruby, JavaScript, React, Redux")
* Level of education
* Work Experience
* Demonstrable, shipped large-scale projects
* Speaking engagements, panels, symposia, etc.

# Pre-Screen

The pre-screen phase is designed to test whether we have sufficient information
that suggests you will be successful in this role. The hope is that by
providing us with these artifacts, the candidate can provide a profile in a way
that's minimally disruptive to their current day-to-day activities.

## Desired Artifacts In Pre-Screen

* Resume
* Cover Letter / Letter of Introduction
* GitHub repository with URLs to repos that show off one's best work (specified in Cover Letter)
* Published technical writing / technical education writing samples
* "Homework:" a response to a [Writing Sample](#writing-sample)

<a name="writing-sample"></a>

## Writing Sample

To create an even bar across candidates we have created the repository:

https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/git-interview-baseline

Here we ask candidates to edit a legacy snapshot of a document about git
revision control. How they respond and what they catch will be informative
about their pedagogical priorities.

# Evaluation Period

Upon providing the "Homework" and the "Desired Artifacts," the candidate's work
will be evaluated. Curriculum will respond within 48 business-hours with a
decision to move forward or not.

# Pre-Onsite Interview

In the event the candidate is granted an "Onsite Interview:"

* Candidate should sign up for Flatiron Bootcamp Prep in order to understand
  the product and experience we're currently offering. They can access this
  through:  https://learn.co/sign_up

# On-Site Interview

Congratulations, we're looking to learn more about you in person. Expect to be
asked your opinions about Bootcamp Prep, to discuss some of your writing sample
work, to discuss technical knowledge that is implicit in full-stack web
development. We don't expect you to know every flag to Rails or every CSS
selector, however knowing quirks in JavaScript or to theorize a learning path
for 5 (given) topics in ES6 is the right neighborhood.

# Evaluation

At this time the team will determine whether to offer a job offer.
