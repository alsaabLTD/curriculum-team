# Hiring

Hiring for Curriculum development is very difficult. Hires generally fall
somewhere on this spectrum:

Technical Writer -------------------------------------------- Software engineer
                                                             

## Recruiting from Technical Writers

**PLUSES**: They can write, they understand voice, they understand style, they
understand taking technical information and making it digestible  
**CONS**: At the far-left extreme, they don't have the ability to _generate_
content. They need a technician to generate the content which they re-craft.
This is a sub-optimal match for FI because we need that _generative_
capability.

## Recruiting from Software Developers

**PLUSES**: They have a long history of digesting technical documentation
and implementing it. They can generate the tasks required to do technical work
**CONS**: At the far-right extreme, they don't have the ability to empathize
and engage with a _reader_. Owing to a lack of history or credits in humanities
classes they have likely been de-incentivized from practicing writing in _human
language_.

## Recruiting in the Middle

We therefore need to find someone who can generate code and can think about how
to generate code. Not only this but they can take those steps and can craft
them into student-engaging, empathetic, content.

Since bad writing can be re-crafted, our bias, if we _have_ to have one, is for
software developers who can write decently. Signs that they have this ability
will be conference talks, blog posts, insightful Stack Overflow posts, etc. A
busy code portfolio and a less-busy writing portfolio is preferable to a quite
code portfolio and a robust writing portfolio.
