# Curriculum Development Tools

## Powerful Text Editor

We write, a lot. Your preferred tools need to be a text editor that makes you
_lethal_. 

## (Optional) Markdown Editor

We write, a lot, in Markdown. If you benefit from a WYSIWYG editor, use it.
HOWEVER, make sure the code you check in is matches with our [style guide][].

In general, you will need to do some text transformation (see "Powerful Text
Editor") in order to make it compliant. Steven recommends learning to "read"
Markdown in ASCII, but your mileage may vary.

## Git

You will need to become a `git` master in this role. Common behaviors:

* branching
* rebasing interactively
* melding commits
* cleaning up commit histories

If this is a growth area, signal it early.
