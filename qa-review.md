## QA Process: major changes with outside reviewers, viewing the changes within the Learn.co platform
1. If not already added/created, add or create the topic to QA-Curriculum track
  - Visit the [Learn.co curriculum](https://learn.co/curriculum/) page
  - Locate and click on the QA-Curriculum track
    ![QA-curriculum track](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-track.png)
  - Mouse over the grey dot on the left sidebar (SS). It will turn into a blue plus sign.
    ![QA-curriculum blue plus sign](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-blue-plus.png)
  - Click on the plus sign.
  - Choose either Create Topic or Find Topic.
    - If creating a topic, give your topic a name.
        ![Name your topic](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-name-your-topic.png)
    - If finding a topic, first pick the track from which you'd like to clone the topic.
      ![Find your track](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-find-your-track.png)
    - Next, select the topic you'd like to clone. You may re-name the topic if necessary.

2. If not already added, add the reviewer to the Qa Review batch.

  - Select the qa-review batch under Curriculum (Internal) on the left sidebar.
    ![Find your batch](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-select-batch.png)
  - Add the reviewer under the appropriate category. For most non-technical reviewers, this will be as a student. This is a judgement call on your part, depending on how much access the reviewer should have.
  ![Add reviewer to the batch](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-add-member-to-batch.png)
    - To add a reviewer as a student, click the blue + Students link at the top of the page.

5. Email reviewers to inform them that they have new content to review.
#### Suggested email message:
Thank you for your availability. Your review of the {{INSERT SECTION HERE}} will ensure it will be in the best state possible before we release it our students.

The objective of the material is {{INSERT OBEJCTIVE/S HERE}}

The revised material includes {{NUMBER}} lessons, and we are asking you to focus on the following:
-  {{Lesson 1 name, with link}}
-  {{Lesson 2 name, with link}}
- etc...

You can find a full list of the updated material here:{{INSERT LINK}}

During the review feel free to create a branch with your edits (please prefix the name of the branch with `wip-`) or open an issue on our Trello board: https://trello.com/b/dujVgBTU/curriculum-big-issues under the {{INSERT SECTION NAME}} section. Please include the lesson name, issue, and the suggested edit.

Ideally, your review will focus on the details of your assigned lesson. {{FULL REVIEWER}} will be our review hero and will read all the lessons to review the overall content flow.

Let me know it if it would be beneficial to schedule a short meeting to kick off the review and ask any questions that might help you in reviewing the material. I am also available to schedule a discussion after you complete your review to collect your input.

We ask that you complete your review by {{DEADLINE}}. Let us know if this is not feasible.

Thank you again,
{{YOUR NAME}}

## Minor Changes
