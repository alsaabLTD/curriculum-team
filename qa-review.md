## QA Process: major changes with outside reviewers, viewing the changes within the Learn.co platform
1. If not already added/created, add or create the topic to QA-Curriculum track
  - Visit the [Learn.co curriculum](https://learn.co/curriculum/) page
  - Locate and click on the QA-Curriculum track
    ![QA-curriculum track](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-track.png)
  - Mouse over the grey dot on the left sidebar (SS). It will turn into a blue plus sign.
    ![QA-curriculum blue plus sign](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-blue-plus.png)
  - Click on the plus sign.
  - Choose either Create Topic or Find Topic.
    - If creating a topic, give your topic a name.
        ![Name your topic](./img/qa-process/qa-curriculum-name-your-topic.png)
    - If finding a topic, first pick the track from which you'd like to clone the topic.

2. If not already added, add the reviewer to the Qa Review batch.
  - Visit [https://learn.co/batches/](https://learn.co/batches/).
  - Select the qa-review batch under Curriculum (Internal) on the left sidebar.
  - Add the reviewer under the appropriate category. For most non-technical reviewers, this will be as a student. This is a judgement call on your part, depending on how much access the reviewer should have.
    - To add a reviewer as a student, click the blue + Students link at the top of the page.
    - To add a reviewer as an admin or teaching assistant, click on the blue + link in the right sidebar.
    - Use the box to search for the reviewer's name or email address. If the reviewer is a Flatiron School employee, clicking on their name should bring up the correct email address for them.
3. Publish updated lessons to the QA-curriculum track.
4. Email reviewers to inform them that they have new content to review.
