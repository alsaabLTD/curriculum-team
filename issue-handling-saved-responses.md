## Misunderstanding of Challenge

```
 Hello,

It looks like this isn't a bug in the curriculum, but a misunderstanding you
have with the material. That's no problem though! Go ahead and hit the Ask A
Question button on learn.co. Either a community member or a technical coach
will be able to help you understand this stuff.

Good luck.
