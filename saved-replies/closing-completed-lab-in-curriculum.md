Hi there,

Pull requests for completed labs should be opened on the appropriate repository in the [`learn-co-students`](https://github.com/learn-co-students) organization. PRs submitted against `learn-co-curriculum` repositories should be reserved for proposed edits and improvements to the curriculum itself.

The [Learn Help Center](http://help.learn.co/) has [an article](http://help.learn.co/workflow-tips/github/how-to-manually-open-a-lab) on how to manually fork and clone a lab from the correct repository. If you require additional assistance, pop into [Ask a Question](http://help.learn.co/ask-a-question/where-can-i-ask-a-question-about-a-lesson) (AAQ), where the [Technical Coaches](http://help.learn.co/instructional-support/receiving-course-support/who-are-the-technical-coaches) (on [supported tracks](http://help.learn.co/instructional-support/receiving-course-support/does-my-program-or-course-have-technical-coach-support)) and fellow community members can provide additional help.

Thanks! ðŸ’™
