Hi there,

Would you mind providing a bit more detail about the issue? Things that are especially useful:

- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Details about your environment.
  + What's your operating system? Which version?
  + Are you using the Learn IDE or a local development environment?
- A [stack trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace) of any errors.

Thanks! ðŸ’™
