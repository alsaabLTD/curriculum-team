* _Standing Items_
* New Business Items
  * Game Plan
  * 1/1 Reschedules (Steven)
  * Style Updates (Steven)
    * 80-column validation should be more enforced because it eases ability
      for discussion
    * Use AP title style
    * Readable.io score target (`[6.0,8.0)`); 6.x is for
      READMEs and 7.x are for technical material. We should all have
      readable.io accounts now. Let's use them and plan to review in 1 month.
