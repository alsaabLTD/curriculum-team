This Readme is a summary of the technical markdown expectations for the `README.md` document files in lesson repositories. 

As a reminder, all repositories **must** have:

* a `.learn` file 
* a `LICENSE.md` file for public-facing content
* a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that outlines contribution guidelines 
* a `README.md` that contains the content of the reading

*Use the gem discussed in [Section 1](/overview.md) to add .learn, License, and Contributing files.*

# Readme Outline:

Readmes, or Readings, are defined as repositories that can contain no additional interactive files beyond the `README.md` file.

##### Examples 

Reading: 

  * [Ruby — Object Attributes And Methods](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/ruby-object-attrs-readme)
  * [Objc — Sorting Basics](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/reading-ios-sorting-basic)


# `#` Title 

( The reading's name should be a descriptive phrase about its content. )

## `##` Overview

A 1-2 sentence summary of what will be covered in the Reading. 

## `##` Objectives

 1. Every reading should have a list of learning objectives that will describe what the student should be able to do or show after completing the lesson.
 2. It should be a numbered list, in most cases with around 3 to 7 items.
 3. And written in the present-imperative tense. Overusing the verbs "learn", "recognize", "know", and "understand" should be avoided (e.g. good: "Run the test suite." vs bad: "Learn to run a test." or "Running tests." or "Know how to run a test.").

## `##` Exposition

Remember to create a narrative that has a beginning, middle, and end.

Provide a brief introduction that explains why we are learning what we are learning. Give a real-world or pseudo-real-world example of using the technology/skill being discussed. 

Discuss the topic of the reading. Break into sections and sub-sections as appropriate to help with the reader's orientation with the material and future referencing.

Be opinionated! There are many ways to solve a problem with code and there are many ways to implement certain technologies, methods, etc. There are however, *best* ways to utilize these technologies, methods, techniques and we should be clear about that when we present multiple options. 

## Resources

This is an optional section, but list and link to resources, articles, and websites that you think will be beneficial for additional reading.
